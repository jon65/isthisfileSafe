5. Review the Results
The results of the analysis will be saved in the /analysis directory, including:

strace_output.txt: Contains the system call trace of the executable.
network_capture.pcap: Captured network traffic during the execution.
Additional logs and outputs based on your custom analysis.
6. Security Considerations
Network Isolation: Ensure the Docker container has limited or no network access to prevent the analyzed file from communicating with external servers.
Resource Limits: Set CPU and memory limits for the Docker container to prevent potential abuse.
Monitoring and Timeouts: Implement timeouts and monitors to kill the process if it runs too long or exhibits suspicious behavior.
By running files in this controlled environment, you can safely analyze potentially malicious files without risking your host system, and capture valuable data about their behavior for further analysis.
